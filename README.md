# hello-world

Hello!

My name is Brandon. I code for fun and am just learning how to apply what I have learned to real projects.
I am looking forward to learning more code and creating wonderful applications!

' So is it that any code can go in here? Doesn't matter the language, the purpose?
' This is just to have a space to code and then all "code" has to be copy/pasted
' to another platform?

Dim test as bool
test = false

i = 1

Do While Test = False
  If i >= 5 then
    Test = True
  End If
  
  i = i + 1
Loop

msgbox(i)
